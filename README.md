# Bizly Take-Home Exercise - Markdown Editor

Hey there! We are excited that you are interested in joining our team at Bizly.

This exercise helps us gain a deeper understanding of your technical capabilities and how you solve problems. It should take no longer than 1-2 hours for this task. Creativity is highly encouraged, and you're welcome to use any libraries and tools. 

To help us get started, we've bootstrapped the project with [Create React App](http://create-react-app.dev/) using the TypeScript template. Please fork this repository, and submit the results by sharing your fork with usâ€”we enjoy seeing your commits.

We can't wait to see what you have to show us!

## What is the exercise?

We want to build a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor that follows the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specifications. The CommonMark specification is quite extensive, so we have identified a couple of key use cases that we would like to address for our users in our first iteration:

1. Top 3 levels of [ATX headings](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#atx-headings).
1. Simple [paragraph] texts.
1. Two flavors of [emphases](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis).
1. Single level unordered and ordered [lists](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#lists) using only `-` and `1` characters, respectively.
1. [Blockquotes](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#block-quotes) containing plain text.

## How do I get started?

We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but plain old NPM works too.

Run `yarn install` in the project directory to get started.

### Available Scripts

This project contains all of scripts shipped with Create React App, see [CRA documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/) for more information. We will outline the scripts most relevant to our exercise below.

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
